        To play Fahrstuhl(elevator), you need a deck of cards and at least 2 players.
        \n
        \nEach round, the number of cards displayed is dealt to each player.
        \nIts important to remove the jokers.
        \n
        \nNow everyone looks at their cards and says how many stitches they will have this round. This is noted in the appropriate "Prediction" field. Then play and the tricks are noted in the "Trick" field .
        \n
        \nIf you correctly predicted the tricks, you get 5 points for each trick. If you are wrong, you get -2 points for each wrong.
        \n
        \nA special feature is that if you say 0 stitches before and get 0 stitches, you still get 5 points.
